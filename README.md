2024-03-01,AWSLambda,8.92,acct-prod,prod,us-east-1
```

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **Transform Functions** (`/lib/transforms.js`): Pure functions for all data calculations
- **Main Dashboard** (`/app/page.js`): Complete React component with Chart.js integration
- **Sample Data** (`/public/sample_billing.csv`): Pre-loaded realistic dataset

### Key Transform Functions
- `daily_totals()`: Group and sum costs by date
- `cost_by_service()`: Aggregate spending by service  
- `project_month_end()`: Calculate projected monthly spending
- `top_movers()`: Identify services with biggest cost changes
- `calculateKPIs()`: Generate key performance indicators

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React 18, Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **CSV Processing**: Papa Parse
- **Date Handling**: date-fns
- **Export**: Canvas-based PNG downloads

## Performance

- **Optimized for 50,000+ rows**: Client-side filtering handles large datasets smoothly
- **Real-time Analytics**: Instant filter updates without API calls
- **Memory Efficient**: Pure functions with minimal state management
- **Fast Rendering**: Virtualized components for large data sets

## Data Validation

The dashboard includes comprehensive validation:
- **Missing Columns**: Detects and reports missing required fields
- **Date Validation**: Ensures proper YYYY-MM-DD format
- **Numeric Validation**: Validates cost_usd as valid numbers
- **Error Reporting**: Clear, actionable error messages
- **Graceful Handling**: Continues processing valid rows when errors exist

## Testing

Unit tests are provided for all core transform functions:

```bash
# Run tests (when Jest is configured)
npm test
```

Tests cover:
- Data aggregation accuracy
- Edge cases (empty data, single records)
- Date calculations and projections
- CSV validation logic
- Top movers calculations

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+  
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
